All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players; They have their exits and their entrances, And one man in his time plays many parts, His acts being seven ages.
Good Night, Good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow, that I shall say good night till it be morrow.
Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look; He thinks too much: such men are dangerous
Fair is foul, and foul is fair
Yet do I fear thy nature; It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
Have more than thou showest, speak less than thou knowest, lend less than thou owes
To mourn a mischief that is past and gone is the next way to draw new mischief on
We are such stuff as dreams are made on, rounded with a little sleep
The better part of valour is discretion
The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose
