hi
I'm still a little confused on how this works. I'm currently living in a temporary sober house. I've been homeless and may be disabled in the past five years. Any way please include me in any future drawings for housing. I thought by being picked in the lottery I entered five years ago, i'd be sort of at the top of whatever lists you use.

Anyway, I'm currently living with multiple people who are also looking for housing. Is there any web site where we can look up how all this housing stuff works?
