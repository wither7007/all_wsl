Chris, I think I was around this afternoon, but anyway.

Here are the things I'm working on.

Behind the wheel driver exam.
========================
This is tricky. The process is login to DMV website (https://onlineservices.dps.mn.gov/EServices/_/#0). And check for a opening. multiple times a day.   They only schedule 30 days in advance, but every DMV location in the state always says "No availability". 

I'm guessing if an availability pops up it will be a matter of jumping on it right away and making actual transporation arrangements on the fly.

Housing.
==========================
I am approved for Section 8 housing, but finding someone to help me figure out the actual lease application is a another hurdle. I do have a County Housing Advisor, plus a regular County Social worker

You are approved for services again. I’ll be out at the lodge tomorrow afternoon if you are around and we can meet and go over things that you need assistance with. 

Thank you
