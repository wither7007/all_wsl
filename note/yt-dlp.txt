                                     The download will be considered successful

                                     from google videos for the search term
                                     "large apple". Use the value "auto" to let
                                     yt-dlp guess ("auto_warning" to emit a
                                     warning when guessing). "error" just throws
                                     an error. The default value "fixup_error"
                                     repairs broken URLs, but emits an error if
                                     this is not possible instead of searching

    --match-filter FILTER            Generic video filter. Any field (see
                                     "OUTPUT TEMPLATE") can be compared with a
                                     number or a string using the operators
                                     defined in "Filtering formats". You can
                                     also simply specify a field to match if the
                                     field is present and "!field" to check if
                                     the field is not present. In addition,
                                     Python style regular expression matching
                                     can be done using "~=", and multiple
                                     filters can be checked with "&". Use a "\"
                                     to escape "&" or quotes if needed. Eg:
                                     --match-filter "!is_live & like_count>?100
                                     & description~='(?i)\bcats \& dogs\b'"
                                     matches only videos that are not live, has
                                     a like count more than 100 (or the like
                                     field is not available), and also has a
                                     description that contains the phrase "cats
                                     & dogs" (ignoring case)

                                     this option multiple times to set different

                                     example, --downloader aria2c --downloader
                                     "dash,m3u8:native" will use aria2c for
                                     http/ftp downloads, and the native
                                     downloader for dash/m3u8 downloads (Alias:

    --downloader-args NAME:ARGS      Give these arguments to the external
                                     downloader. Specify the downloader name and

                                     ffmpeg, arguments can be passed to
                                     different positions using the same syntax
                                     as --postprocessor-args. You can use this
                                     option multiple times to give different
                                     arguments to different downloaders (Alias:

                                     given regular expression. Time ranges
                                     prefixed by a "*" can also be used in place
                                     of chapters to remove the specified range.
                                     Eg: --remove-chapters "*10:15-15:00"
                                     --remove-chapters "intro". This option can

                                     removing/splitting them. Requires a
                                     reencode and thus is very slow, but the
                                     resulting video may have fewer artifacts
                                     around the cuts
    --no-force-keyframes-at-cuts     Do not force keyframes around the chapters

                                     seperated by a colon ":". ARGS are a
                                     semicolon ";" delimited list of NAME=VALUE.

                                     postprocessor is invoked. It can be one of
                                     "pre_process" (after extraction),
                                     "before_dl" (before video download),
                                     "post_process" (after video download;
                                     default) or "after_move" (after moving file
                                     to their final locations). This option can
                                     be used multiple times to add different
                                     postprocessors
