Tell all the truth but tell it slant —
Success in Circuit lies
Too bright for our infirm Delight
The Truth's superb surprise
As Lightning to the Children eased
With explanation kind
The Truth must dazzle gradually
Or every man be blind —

If you haven't heard about Piped before, in simple terms, it is an alternative frontend that is designed to be efficient by design, where you can watch YouTube without making any connections to Google's servers and have subscriptions without a google account.

After 8 months of development, I am finally excited to share the project at its current state!

The reason why this project was created was to create a truly unique alternative to Invidious, with performance and stability as the primary goal.

For those of you who want to try out Piped, you may do so at https://piped.kavin.rocks/

If you would like to contribute with code, you may do so at https://github.com/TeamPiped/Piped

Disillusionment of Ten O'Clock
 The houses are haunted
 By white night-gowns.
 None are green,
 Or purple with green rings,
 Or green with yellow rings,
 Or yellow with blue rings.
 None of them are strange,
 With socks of lace
 And beaded ceintures.
 People are not going
 To dream of baboons and periwinkles.
 Only, here and there, an old sailor,
 Drunk and asleep in his boots,
 Catches tigers
 In red weather.

The find command syntax is hairy enough, so why bring another command into it? If you use find's "-exec" option, it will spin up a new process each time it searches through a file in the directory. Using xargs is more efficient.

git reset --hard # removes staged and working directory changes

## !! be very careful with these !!
## you may end up deleting what you don't want to
## read comments and manual.
git clean -f -d # remove untracked
git clean -f -x -d # CAUTION: as above but removes ignored files like config.
git clean -fxd :/ # CAUTION: as above, but cleans untracked and ignored files through the entire repo (without :/, the operation affects only the current directory)
To see what will be deleted before-hand, without actually deleting it, use the -n flag (this is basically a test-run). When you are ready to actually delete, then remove the -n flag:

git clean -nfd
