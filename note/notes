PNG is the best choice for graphs, the pics with text, screenshots, and for designs that require the use of transparency, such as logo designs and similar. However, the biggest downside is that they are greater in size and they will slow down your website.

JPG, on the other hand, is smaller and faster to load, but the compression comes in hand with some loss in quality which is usually not a problem for photographs, but it can be bad for text or images containing fine lines.

Do not remove a fence until you know why it was put up in the first place.
Chesterton went on to explain why this principle holds true, writing that fences don’t grow out of the ground, nor do people build them in their sleep or during a fit of madness. He explained that fences are built by people who carefully planned them out and “had some reason for thinking [the fence] would be a good thing for somebody.”

A wing is shaped and tilted so the air moving over it moves faster than the air moving under it. As air speeds up, its pressure goes down. So the faster-moving air above exerts less pressure on the wing than the slower-moving air below. The result is an upward push on the wing—lift!

W bosons, together with Z bosons, mediate the weak force, one of the universe’s four fundamental forces. Unlike gravity, electromagnetism and the strong force, the weak force doesn’t push or pull so much as it transforms heavier particles into lighter ones. A muon spontaneously decays into a W boson and a neutrino, for instance, and the W then becomes an electron and another neutrino. Related subatomic shape-shifting causes radioactivity and helps keep the sun shining.

Can someone help me see a charitable framing of the phrase "not even wrong", as used in articles like this?
My best guess is that it's equivalent to him saying that he disagrees with a position's premises. But in a deeply pejorative, dismissive, condescending, conversation-ending manner.

It's hard to imagine someone in those crosshairs wanting to engage with him in discussion.

But, maybe I'm badly misreading the author's intent.
