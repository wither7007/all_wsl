I see this all the time. Agnosticism isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúnot knowing‚Äù, otherwise everyone is agnostic. An agnostic believes it‚Äôs not even possible to know, and it‚Äôs not mutually exclusive to belief or lack thereof.

multiples are kHz (kilohertz, 103 Hz), MHz (megahertz, 106 Hz), GHz (gigahertz, 109 Hz) and THz (terahertz, 1012 Hz). One hertz simply means "one event per second" (where the event being counted may be a complete cycle); 100 Hz means "one hundred events per second", and so on. The unit may be applied to any periodic event‚Äîfor example, a clock might be said to tick at 1 Hz, or a human heart might be said to beat at 1.2 Hz.

Astronomers don‚Äôt believe the universe is 13.78 billion years old‚Äîthey know it.
cells 37 trillion
But human cells are not the only cells in our bodies. Although previous studies have estimated that there are 10 times as many bacteria in our bodies than human cells, Prof. Milo and colleagues revised this number to be around 38 trillion.

Interestingly, although large in number, bacteria are much smaller than human cells, and they actually make up only 200 grams of total body mass, according to Prof. Milo.
Azevedo and colleagues took a crack at a more precise estimate. Their answer?

Approximately 86 billion neurons in the human brain. The latest estimates for the number of stars in the Milky Way is somewhere between 200 and 400 billion. So close, but the human brain certainly doesn't quite stack up!
But with nearly equal numbers of cells in our bodies, one could argue that we are as much bacteria as we are human, bringing the total number up to around 70 trillion.

How does WMAP data enable us to determine the age of the universe is 13.77 billion years, with an uncertainty of only 0.4%? The key to this is that by knowing the composition of matter and energy density in the universe, we can use Einstein's General Relativity to compute how fast the universe has been expanding in the past. With that information, we can turn the clock back and determine when the universe had "zero" size, according to Einstein

dBm stands for decibel milliwatts. dBm can be used in radio, microwave, and fiber-optical networks as a measure of absolute power because of its capability to express both very large and very small values in short form. The closer the number is to 0, the better off your signal strength is

A wing is shaped and tilted so the air moving over it moves faster than the air moving under it. As air speeds up, its pressure goes down. So the faster-moving air above exerts less pressure on the wing than the slower-moving air below. The result is an upward push on the wing‚Äîlift!

If you want better range, use 2.4 GHz. If you need higher performance or speed, use the 5GHz band. The 5GHz band, which is the newer of the two, has the potential to cut through network clutter and interference to maximize network performance. Which means this band will be better for things like reducing game lag.

W bosons, together with Z bosons, mediate the weak force, one of the universe‚Äôs four fundamental forces. Unlike gravity, electromagnetism and the strong force, the weak force doesn‚Äôt push or pull so much as it transforms heavier particles into lighter ones. A muon spontaneously decays into a W boson and a neutrino, for instance, and the W then becomes an electron and another neutrino. Related subatomic shape-shifting causes radioactivity and helps keep the sun shining.
