multiples are kHz (kilohertz, 103 Hz), MHz (megahertz, 106 Hz), GHz (gigahertz, 109 Hz) and THz (terahertz, 1012 Hz). One hertz simply means "one event per second" (where the event being counted may be a complete cycle); 100 Hz means "one hundred events per second", and so on. The unit may be applied to any periodic event—for example, a clock might be said to tick at 1 Hz, or a human heart might be said to beat at 1.2 Hz.

Astronomers don’t believe the universe is 13.7 billion years old—they know it.
cells 37 trillion
But human cells are not the only cells in our bodies. Although previous studies have estimated that there are 10 times as many bacteria in our bodies than human cells, Prof. Milo and colleagues revised this number to be around 38 trillion.

Interestingly, although large in number, bacteria are much smaller than human cells, and they actually make up only 200 grams of total body mass, according to Prof. Milo.
Azevedo and colleagues took a crack at a more precise estimate. Their answer?

Approximately 86 billion neurons in the human brain. The latest estimates for the number of stars in the Milky Way is somewhere between 200 and 400 billion. So close, but the human brain certainly doesn't quite stack up!
But with nearly equal numbers of cells in our bodies, one could argue that we are as much bacteria as we are human, bringing the total number up to around 70 trillion.

How does WMAP data enable us to determine the age of the universe is 13.77 billion years, with an uncertainty of only 0.4%? The key to this is that by knowing the composition of matter and energy density in the universe, we can use Einstein's General Relativity to compute how fast the universe has been expanding in the past. With that information, we can turn the clock back and determine when the universe had "zero" size, according to Einstein

PNG is the best choice for graphs, the pics with text, screenshots, and for designs that require the use of transparency, such as logo designs and similar. However, the biggest downside is that they are greater in size and they will slow down your website.

JPG, on the other hand, is smaller and faster to load, but the compression comes in hand with some loss in quality which is usually not a problem for photographs, but it can be bad for text or images containing fine lines.

Do not remove a fence until you know why it was put up in the first place.
Chesterton went on to explain why this principle holds true, writing that fences don’t grow out of the ground, nor do people build them in their sleep or during a fit of madness. He explained that fences are built by people who carefully planned them out and “had some reason for thinking [the fence] would be a good thing for somebody.”

A wing is shaped and tilted so the air moving over it moves faster than the air moving under it. As air speeds up, its pressure goes down. So the faster-moving air above exerts less pressure on the wing than the slower-moving air below. The result is an upward push on the wing—lift!

If you want better range, use 2.4 GHz. If you need higher performance or speed, use the 5GHz band. The 5GHz band, which is the newer of the two, has the potential to cut through network clutter and interference to maximize network performance. Which means this band will be better for things like reducing game lag.

W bosons, together with Z bosons, mediate the weak force, one of the universe’s four fundamental forces. Unlike gravity, electromagnetism and the strong force, the weak force doesn’t push or pull so much as it transforms heavier particles into lighter ones. A muon spontaneously decays into a W boson and a neutrino, for instance, and the W then becomes an electron and another neutrino. Related subatomic shape-shifting causes radioactivity and helps keep the sun shining.

I'm a liberal-minded, never-say-never guy, but I honestly think it's more likely that I will one day learn to fly by flapping my hands really quickly than I will believe in god, especially when the arguments for it are presented in such a pseudo-academic way. I still can't get over the feeling it's like the clasic image of the theologians arguing over how many angels can fit on the head of a pen.:w

Can someone help me see a charitable framing of the phrase "not even wrong", as used in articles like this?
My best guess is that it's equivalent to him saying that he disagrees with a position's premises. But in a deeply pejorative, dismissive, condescending, conversation-ending manner.

It's hard to imagine someone in those crosshairs wanting to engage with him in discussion.

But, maybe I'm badly misreading the author's intent.

Oh, Orville helped. An obsessive tinkerer and gifted mechanic, he was invaluable in building the Wright flyer, and yes, he piloted the first flight on Dec. 17, 1903. (The brothers supposedly flipped a coin for the honor, and Wilbur lost. Wilbur got to fly later in the day and went farther.) Yet Wilbur was the brains of the operation.

"The world is fine. The people are fucked!" -George Carlin
Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that.
A house is just a place to keep your stuff while you go out and get more stuff.
You show me a lazy p***k who’s lying in bed all day, watching TV, only occasionally getting up to p**s, and I’ll show you a guy who’s not causing any trouble.
I’m happy to tell you there is very little in this world that I believe in
When I ask how old your toddler is, I don’t need to hear ’27 months.’ ‘He’s two’ will do just fine. He’s not a cheese. And I didn’t really care in the first place
Would a fly without wings be called a walk
It’s important in life if you don’t give a s**t. It can help you a lot
People who say they don’t care what people think are usually desperate to have people think they don’t care what people think
People who see life as anything more than pure entertainment are missing the point

We live in an imperfect society where extremists leverage the very real flaws to insist that everything is absolutely corrupt and that we should embrace the exact opposite of anything that’s imperfect. Vaccines don’t prevent 100% of all infections for everyone? They’re obviously complete frauds that do no good at all.
The sad thing is that we have real problems, and this nihilistic insistence that everything is fake means that those problems will only get worse.

vaccinations have prevented a lot of suffering

What is truth? said jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer." Thus begins Francis Bacon's essay on truth, published in 1597. Bacon was referring to the Gospel of St. John, in which Pilate wearily tries to make sense of the Jewish high priest's complaints against Jesus. Jesus is riddling and evasive in his answers to the charges, or so it must have appeared to Pilate, and ends by saying: "For this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice." On that note, Pilate tosses out his rhetorical question and leaves to tell the Jews that he can find no fault with Jesus.

[T]he two most salient traits of the radical movement are its anti-intellectualism and its hostility to the university as an institution. ... Intellectuals, by definition, are people who take ideas seriously for their own sake. Whether or not a theory is true or false is important to them, independently of any practical applications it may have. [Intellectuals] have, as Richard Hofstadter has pointed out, an attitude to ideas that is at once playful and pious. But, in the radical movement, the intellectual ideal of knowledge for its own sake is rejected. Knowledge is seen as valuable only as a basis for action, and it is not even very valuable there. Far more important than what one knows is how one feels
