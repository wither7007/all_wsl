F. Rapid ReHousing, Transitional Housing 
and Permanent Supportive Housing
Supportive housing generally falls into three categories: Rapid 
ReHousing, Transitional Housing, and Permanent Supportive Housing. There are many organizations in the communitythat provide 
supportive housing programs dedicated to those experiencing 
homelessness. All of these programs must be accessed through 
the Coordinated Entry System (see below and page 21). 
Rapid ReHousing (RRH) programs are short term and have 
the goal of moving individuals and families from homelessness to 
housing as quickly as possible. RRH programs provide individuals 
and families with housing search assistance, rental assistance, and 
supportive services/case management. Most RRH programs are 
scattered site which means the program helps both individuals and 
families find housing with market rate landlords out in the community, and the rental assistance ensures the housing is affordable 
and works on increasing their income to be able to afford rent 
on their own. RRH programs vary in their length, but typically 
last three to nine months; though some might be up to two years.
Transitional Housing Programs (THP) last up to two years. 
These programs are often site-based (meaning located in a particular building that is managed by the program), but they can be 
scattered site as well. Transitional Housing programs come with 
intensive case management services designed to prepare families 
for living independently. Some THPs have sobriety requirements.
Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) programs do not 
have time limits; singles and families can stay for as long as they 
remain eligible. PSH programs can be scattered site or site-based 
and come with long-term intensive case management services. 
Some PSH programs have sobriety requirements.
Coordinated Entry System for Families
The Coordinated Entry System helps families in emergency shelter 
access supportive housing programs in Hennepin County.
How it works: Once a family is vouchered into shelter by the 
shelter team, they are included in the coordinated entry process 
automatically. Families staying in domestic violence shelters or 
other private shelters are encouraged to work with their advocates at the shelter to access coordinated entry through calling 
Hennepin County’s Front Door (612-348-4111). 
The Coordinated Entry system involves a screening assessment to 
determine eligibility for homeless-dedicated housing opportunities. If eligible, families are placed in a housing priority pool and 
are referred to housing opportunities based on level of need and 
available openings. 
Note: There are significantly more families in need of housing than 
there are housing openings. Unfortunately, this means that many 
families will not receive a housing referral. If you have completed 
the screening process and have not gotten a call regarding a housing 
opportunity, this means there is not currently an opening available for your family. If you have questions regarding this, contact 
the shelter team if you are staying at a county-funded shelter, or 
contact an advocate at your shelter if you are staying at a domestic 
violence shelter or another private shelter.
Eligibility:
• Families only – must have at least one minor child in your care 
or custody, or currently be pregnant.
• Must be staying in an emergency shelter, including domestic 
violence shelters, or places not meant for human habitation.
• Must be residents of Hennepin County.
• Must remain in shelter to remain eligible.
• Families that are doubled up or couch hopping are not eligible.
Coordinated Entry System for Single Adults
The Coordinated Entry System (CES) helps single adults in emergency shelter or places not meant for human habitation (e.g., in cars 
or living outside) access homeless-dedicated supportive housing 
programs in Hennepin County.
How it works: After entering emergency shelter, if an individual 
is unable to locate housing on their own after two weeks, shelter 
staff will approach that individual and screen them for coordinated 
entry. If an individual is in a place not meant for human habitation 
(camping, outdoors, buses, storage units, etc), street outreach staff 
may identify someone for screening at any point. This screening 
helps determine the individual’s vulnerability, housing preferences, 
and eligibility for homeless-dedicated housing opportunities. If 
eligible, individuals are placed in a housing priority pool and are 
referred to programs based on level of need and available openings. 
Note: 
• There are significantly more individuals in need of housing than 
there are housing openings. Unfortunately, this means that many 
individuals will not receive a housing referral, even if eligible. If you 
have completed the screening process and have not gotten a call 
regarding a housing opportunity, this means there is not currently 
an opening available for you. 
• If your contact info changes or if you have questions about the 
process, notify a street outreach or shelter worker and they can 
update your information or do a status check for you.
• There are other housing programs and resources that are not 
filled through the Coordinated Entry System. It is recommended 
that individuals pursue any housing possibilities, not just those 
accessed through CES.

• Single adults – age 18 and over.
